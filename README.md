ImageRedactor
=============

The Image Redactor allows you to upload a Word or PowerPoint document and redact the images contained within; that is to say it helps change copyright infringing images with free to use, licensed images.

New images inserted into documents are sourced from Flickr using their Creative Commons search facility.

When new images have been found these are inserted into the document in place of the old images and a download link is generated. New images are accompaied with a text box that provides an attribution for the image.

The tool also allows for licence metadata to be embedded in existing images within the document or allows an infringing image to be obfuscated should a suitable replacement not be found.
