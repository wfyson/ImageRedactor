---TODO---

1) Detect PNG images and change file format if appropriate when downloading from Flickr/using placeholder.

2) Detect background images and handle accordingly.

3) Actually include attributions in new PPT.

4) UI improvements (slide numbering). 

---NICE TO HAVE---

1) Allow users to specify how attribution works (?) - either footnote or slide of attributions?

2) Present image sizes to user so can choose one they most like/fits their image.

3) Image editing where appropriate (i.e. where "derivs" are allowed) - cropping of images to fit currently resolution (is cropping a derivation?).

4) Metadata formats for other image types (if available) (already supported by Nihilogic library).

5) Preview thumbnail of presentation somewhere... (but can't make this update seemingly).

6) A logo!
