---TODO---

1) Detect PNG images and change file format if appropriate when downloading from Flickr/using placeholder.

2) Actually include attributions in new PPT.

3) Allow users to specify how attribution works (?) - either footnote or slide of attributions?

4) Present image sizes to user so can choose one they most like/fits their image.

5) Image editing where appropriate (i.e. where "derivs" are allowed) - cropping of images to fit currently resolution (is cropping a derivation?).

6) Metadata formats for other image types (if available) (already supported by Nihilogic library).

7) Preview thumbnail of presentation somewhere... (but can't make this update seemingly).

8) A logo and a name!
